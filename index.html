	<p class="project">About Me</p>
	<p class="description">My name is Haley Frisch. I am working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Stuido Art at Indiana University of Pennsylvania and am expected to graduate in May 2021. While pursuing my degree, I decided to take the graphic design route, which led to me finding a passion for web design. Graduation can't come soon enough. I am constantly looking at web design, front-end development, and graphic design job listings and dreaming about what it will be like to finally start my career.<br><br>I was born at Landstuhl Army Hospital in Germany. Although born at an Army hospital, I was an, "Air Force Brat." I was able to experience different cultures and got to see the world early in life, which helped me become the well rounded person I am today. Throughout my childhood, I got the opportunity to live in Germany, Hawaii, Nebraska, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. I have now been in Pennsylvania for four years.<br><br>I enjoy staying busy in my free time. Teaching myself new things in web design, riding my dirt bike, and playing with my puppies are some of my favorite things to do.</p>
